# PI-Day-Exercises

## Exercise 1: Create a function that generates an ARRAY of 6 random integers (NUMBERS) between 0 and 60. Use a while or for-loop, Math.random(), Math.ceil() and/or Math.floor(). 

## Exercise 2: Create a function that takes a number (a radius) as its argument, and returns the area of the cricle with that radius. Round the area to the closest integer. It doesn't matter if you round up or down.
