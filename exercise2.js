/* EXERCISE 2
/
/ Directions: 
/       Today is 3/14, also known as PI day. 
/       Write a function that calculates the area of a circle when given a radius
/       When I call the function calculateArea(radius), the return value will be the area rounded to the closest integer
/
/       Input (arguments) : Number -- i.e. the radius of the circle
/       Output (return) : Number -- i.e. the area of the circle AS AN INTEGER
/
/       Tools and functions you'll probably need to use: 
/           1) Math.PI (it's a PROPERTY of the Math object...similar to the .length of an array or string!)
/           2) Pick either Math.ceil(n) or Math.floor(n). For this exericse, it doesn't matter if you round up or down. 
/           3) What's the formula for the area of a circle?
